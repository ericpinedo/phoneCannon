# phoneCannon
I've been getting too many fake 'tech support' and 'IRS' phone calls recently...
So I decided to make a a program that floods these dishonest telecommunications centers.

I do not intend to use this program for malicious purposes, the main purpose of this program 
is to motivate myself to learn more about MEAN stack development and REST APIs

First I will attempt to make a functional terminal based application and after successful testing, I will make a working web applicaiton.
